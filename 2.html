	<h1> Robotics Experience </h1>
<p> My time as a first year was very fun. The experience of getting to build my own robot from scratch was really new and exciting, which is why I liked it so much. It's especially satisfying when you finally get the robot to work the way you want it to after working on it for so long. </p>
<p> My favorite activity would have to be the obstacle course competition because it involved a lot of thinking into making the robot and I got the farthest out of everyone so far. I also liked the tank design of my robot.
<p> Overall, I learned that time is limited and that you should never wait till the last minute to do things. Try your best and put effort into your builds because it all pays off in the end.
