	<h1> About Me </h1>
<p>My name is Benny Salvador and I'm currently a senior at Canoga Park High School. Some extra curricular activities I'm doing are Keystone, FFA (partly), Skills USA, and HIP.</p> 
<p>Keystone is a community service programm and FFA (Future Farmers of America) is an organization made to support agricultural education. I'm not an official member, but I'm going to participate in one of their competitions. Skills USA is a robotics programm where one team per school is assigned to make a certain robot and compete against schools.
<p>I want to go into a STEM related field because growing up, I had no idea what I wanted to be, but when I was introduced to robotics/engineering through school and HIP, I realized that I finally found a future career.</p>
