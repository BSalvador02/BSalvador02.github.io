	<h1> Coding Experience </h1>
<p> Recently, I have learned the basics of the HTML, CSS, Python 2 languages thanks to code academy, which provided me with the knowledge of how to begin this website in the first place.
  I'm excited to use this knowledge for other uses such as programming a robot, using Rasberry Pi, etc. Hopefully, I can later get used to these programming languages so I can be able to do these things on my own someday.
