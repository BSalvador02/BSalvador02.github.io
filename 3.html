	<h1> Coding Experience </h1>
<p> Recently, I have learned the basics of the HTML, CSS, and Python 2 languages thanks to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com"> Code Academy</a>, which provided me with the knowledge of how to begin this website in the first place. </p>
<p> I'm excited to use this knowledge for other uses such as programming a robot, using Rasberry Pi, etc. Hopefully, I can later get used to these programming languages so I can be able to do these things on my own someday. </p>
