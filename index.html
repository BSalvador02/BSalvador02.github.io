  <h1>Benny's HIP Website</h1>
  <h3>Welcome to my HIP 2nd year website!.</h3>
<p>I'm currently a senior at Canoga Park Highschool and I hope to get into a CSU or UC to major in mechanical engineering. High School Involvement Partnership (HIP) has completely changed my future by introducing me to software and mechanical engineering.  Here is a <a href="https://www.canogaparkhs.org/">list</a> of cities where you can find us.</p>
